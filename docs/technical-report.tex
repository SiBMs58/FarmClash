\\ $\ast$ TODO: Add more details here. e.g. image of the final db schama

\subsection{Backend Logic}
The backend handles requests from the client, processes game logic, and interacts with the database. It ensures that all player actions are reflected in real-time and manages the continuous accumulation of resources even when the player is offline.
\subsubsection{Login and Authentication Feature}
\paragraph{Login Feature}
The login functionality is critical for user authentication, allowing users to securely access their accounts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Endpoint} The route `/auth/login`(methods=['GET', 'POST']) handles the login requests.
    \item \textbf{Form Processing} When a POST request is received, the server retrieves the username and password from the form data.
    \item \textbf{User Validation} The user details are fetched from the database using user\_data\_access.get\_user(username). The password is verified using werkzeug\_check\_password\_hash.
    \item \textbf{Session Management}  If the credentials are valid, login\_user(user\_record) is called to log the user in, using Flask-Login to handle the session.
    \item \textbf{Response} After successful login, users are redirected to the game interface or admin panel based on their role
    \item \textbf{Error Handling} If login fails, an error message is displayed.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Registration Feature}
Registration allows new users to create accounts by providing their username, password, and email.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Endpoint} The route `/auth/register`(methods=['GET', 'POST']) handles the registration requests.
    \item \textbf{User Creation} On receiving a POST request, it attempts to create a new user record with the provided details. The password should ideally be hashed before storage (though hashing is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code).
    \item \textbf{Account initialization} If the user is successfully added to the database, the system initializes the user's game environment, including creating a default map and initializing resources using GameServices.
    \item \textbf{Response} Successful registration redirects the user to the login page. If registration fails (e.g., if the username is already taken), an error message is provided.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Logout Feature}
The logout functionality securely ends a user's session.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Endpoint} The route `/auth/logout` logs the user out by calling logout\_user() from Flask-Login.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Friends and Messaging Feature}
The friends and messaging features are central to fostering a community environment and enabling social interactions within the game.
\paragraph{Friends Feature:}
The backend supports functionalities related to the management of friendships between users. Users can add new friends, and view their list of friends. The implementation involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Friend Request Management:} Users add friends using a specific API endpoint that updates the database to include a new friendship. This is implemented in the endpoint defined in \texttt{api.py} (see line 96). The endpoint is:
    \begin{verbatim}
    .../add_friend/<string:friend_name>
    \end{verbatim}
    By utilizing the User Data Access, we retrieve data for both the current user and the prospective friend, converting this information into user objects through the get\_user function. Once we have the user data, we create a new friendship by employing the add\_friendship method from the Friendship Data Access class.
    \item \textbf{List of Friends:} Users can retrieve their list of friends through an API call, which fetches the data from the database and returns it in a formatted JSON array. This feature ensures that users can easily access and interact with their friends list. The relevant API call is implemented in \texttt{views/friends.py} (see line 43). The endpoint is:
    \begin{verbatim}
    .../api/friends
    \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Messaging Feature:}
\\ $\ast$ TODO
These features not only enhance user engagement but also contribute to the game's social dynamics, making the gaming experience more interactive and enjoyable for users.
\subsubsection{Leaderboard Feature}
The backend manages the leaderboard by fetching and calculating user scores, sorting them, and handling specific leaderboard queries. Here's how it is structured:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fetch and Calculate Scores:} The route \begin{verbatim}`@api/leaderboard`\end{verbatim} is used for handling GET requests for the leaderboard. It retrieves all users from the database via user\_data\_access.get\_all\_users(). For each user, it calculates the total score by summing up the resources associated with each user, fetched by resource\_data\_access.get\_resources(user.username).
    \item \textbf{Sort and Rank Users:} Users are sorted by their calculated scores in descending order. The backend extracts the top three users to represent the leading positions on the leaderboard. Additionally, it retrieves two friends of the current user to include in the leaderboard for more personalized competition.
    \item \textbf{Ensure Inclusion of Current User:} The system checks if the current user is among the top users or friends listed. If not, the current user is also added to the leaderboard. It then removes duplicates and finalizes a ranked list of unique users.
    \item \textbf{Return Leaderboard Data:} The backend returns the leaderboard data in JSON format, including the user's rank, username, and score. This data is then displayed on the frontend for users to view and engage with.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frontend Interface}
The frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly interface using React, allowing players to engage with the game seamlessly. It features a map view for navigating different parts of the farm and a market interface for selling produce.
\subsubsection{Login and Authentication Feature}
\paragraph{Login Page}
The login page offers a straightforward interface for existing users to access their accounts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HTML and CSS:} Structure: The login form is embedded within a div element styled with a form-container class. It includes input fields for username and password. Styling: Stylesheets for authentication (auth.css) and footer (footer.css) are linked to maintain consistency in appearance with the rest of the application. The Press Start 2P font from Google Fonts enhances the retro aesthetic of the app.
    \item \textbf{JavaScript:} Dynamic Visual Feedback: JavaScript is used to provide visual feedback on the login button. It changes the button's image when pressed and released, helping confirm user interaction. Form Submission: The form posts data to the /auth/login endpoint, handling user authentication in the backend.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Registration Page}
The registration page allows new users to create an account by providing essential information such as username, password, and email.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HTML and CSS:} Extended Form: Similar to the login form but includes an additional field for email to accommodate the registration process. Consistent Styling: Utilizes the same CSS files as the login page for a uniform look and feel.
    \item \textbf{JavaScript:} Button Feedback: Implements the same interactive feedback for the registration button, enhancing user experience during the account creation process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Friends and Messaging Feature}
\subsubsection{Leaderboard Feature}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HTML and CSS:} The leaderboard.html contains the HTML structure, including a table where the leaderboard will be dynamically populated. The CSS file leaderboard.css styles the leaderboard page, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.
    \item \textbf{JavaScript:} A JavaScript function loadLeaderboard() (event handling; this function is triggered when document content is fully loaded) is responsible for fetching the leaderboard data from the backend API. Upon successful fetch, it populates the leaderboard table in the HTML dynamically. Error handling is incorporated to manage and alert users in case of failures in data retrieval.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Books}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HTML and CSS:} The bookChat.html and bookMarket.html contain the HTML structure of the books, covers and pages (front and back), along with the content for the chat and the market respectively.
    \item \textbf{JavaScript:} There is a JavaScript function: openBook() to open the cover of the book and a closeBook() to close the cover of the book. In addition, you have the goNextPage() function to go to the next page and the goPrevPage() function to go to the previous page. In addition to these functions, there are querySelectors for the covers, pages and buttons
